## Introduction
This repository includes several heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms developed as part of the curriculum at Yunnan University. These algorithms are designed to provide efficient solutions to complex optimization problems.

## Algorithms Included
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: `AntTSP.java`
- **Tabu Search**: `TabuColoring.java`
- **Simulated Annealing**: `SimaColorings.java`
- **Graph Coloring**: `GraphColoring.java`

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/davidwushi1145/heuristic-algorithm.git
```
Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

## Usage
To run any of the algorithms, compile the Java files and execute the main class. For example, to run the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for TSP:
```sh
javac AntTSP.java
java AntTSP
```
Refer to the specific Java files for additional parameters and configurations.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. Ensure that your code follows the coding standards and includes appropriate documentation.
